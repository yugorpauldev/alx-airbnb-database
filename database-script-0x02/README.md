# Task 3: Seed the Database with Sample Data

## Objective
Create SQL scripts to populate the database with sample data for tables such as `User`, `Property`, `Booking`, and related entities, ensuring the data reflects realistic real-world scenarios.

## Instructions
1. Write SQL `INSERT` statements to add sample data for the following tables:
   - `User`: Include multiple users with varied roles (e.g., guests, hosts).
   - `Property`: Add properties with different types, locations, and pricing.
   - `Booking`: Create bookings linking users and properties, with realistic dates and statuses.
   - Other related tables (e.g., `Payment`, `Review`): Include relevant data to simulate real-world usage.
2. Ensure the sample data is diverse and representative of typical platform interactions, such as multiple users making bookings for different properties, varied payment statuses, and realistic review ratings.

## Implementation
The SQL script (`seed.sql`) contains `INSERT` statements to populate the database.
