# Task 0: Write Complex Queries with Joins

## ✅ Objective

Learn how to combine data from multiple tables using SQL JOINs. This task focuses on INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN to connect tables like `User`, `Booking`, `Property`, and `Review`.

---

## 🔧 What You’ll Learn

- The structure and purpose of JOINs
- How to write INNER JOINs to get matching records from two tables
- How to use LEFT JOINs to include unmatched rows from the left table
- How to use FULL OUTER JOINs to include all rows from both tables

## 🔍 JOIN Types Used

### 🔹 INNER JOIN
Returns only the records that have matching values in both tables.

### 🔸 LEFT JOIN
Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right table. If no match, returns NULLs.

### 🔻 FULL OUTER JOIN
Returns all records when there is a match in one of the tables. If there’s no match, the missing side returns NULL.
